# Party Bus ðŸŽ‰ðŸšŒ

This is a distributed event bus using [Tube Mail](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail) under the hood. This means you can emit events over IP networks of any kind - including the Internet. And all of this is secured by TLS connections. So it is safe to use this over non-trustworthy network :)

*Party Bus* was initially developed for building distributed microservices on top. But you can use them whenever you want your events to travel across the Node.js process boundaries.


# Example

Don't be scared - but first of all you need a PKI for the TLS stuff. [Tube Mail](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail) has a bunch of little helper scripts to do that the easy way:

```sh
apt install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

npm install -g tubemail tubemail-mdns partybus

mkdir pki

# Create a config for the PKI. You can adjusted these values.
cat > config.sh <<EOF
COUNTRY="VA"
STATE="Fairyland"
LOCALITY="Rainbow"
EOF

# Create a new realm. All the Party Bus people must live in the same realm.
createRealm party

# For every party-goer we need a private key and certificate
createPeer party dj
createPeer party raver
```

We need an event emitter. Here it is:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

require('partybus')({
	key: fs.readFileSync('./party.dj.key'),
	cert: fs.readFileSync('./party.dj.crt'),
	ca: fs.readFileSync('./party.crt'),
	discovery: require('./mdns.js')()
}).then((party) => {
	// Make some noise!
	const BPM = 140;
	setInterval(() => party.emit('music', 'utz'), 60 * 1000 / BPM);
});
```

And we need an event consumer:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

require('partybus')({
	key: fs.readFileSync('./party.raver.key'),
	cert: fs.readFileSync('./party.raver.crt'),
	ca: fs.readFileSync('./party.crt'),
	discovery: require('./mdns.js')()
}).then((party) => {
	party.on('music', (beat) => console.log(beat));
});
```

Execute these scripts somewhere on your network. Don't forget to transfer the keys and certificates.

# API

The API is designed to be kind of compatible to the Node.js events library. So you will find some old faces here. The main differences are:
 * The constructor works asynchronous and thus *Party Bus* cannot be inherited into other classes.
 * Since the objects attached to the event are serialised, transmitted and then deserialised, you cannot pass over pointers to some space of your memory. (This happens when you call functions with objects in the arguments.)

Supported instances, that can be transmitted seamlessly with *Party Bus*:
 * Date
 * Buffer

```js
const partybus = require('partybus');
partybus(opts).then((bus) => {...});
```

Joins / create a new event bus. ```opts``` is an object:
 * ```ca```: Realm's certificate. Required.
 * ```key```: Peer's private key. Required.
 * ```cert```: Peer's certificate. Required.
 * ```port```: The port to listen on. Default: ```{from: 4816, to: 4819}```. It can be of type:
   * ```Number```: Listen on the specified port.
   * ```Array```: A list of ports. *Party Bus* will select a free one.
   * ```Object```: A port range. First port is specified by item ```from```, last one by item ```to```.
 * ```discovery```: Factory for discovery. Required. The factory's interface: ```(port, fingerPrint, newPeer) => stopDiscovery```:
   * ```port```: The actual port this peer is listening on.
   * ```fingerPrint```: The realm's finger print for finding other peers. All peers using the same realm certificate will receive the same finger print to search for.
   * ```newPeer```: A callback function that shall be called if discovery discovered a new peer. It awaits one object with the items ```host``` and ```port```. I think you know what to fill in ;)
   * ```stopDiscovery```: Will be called by *Party Bus* if discovery shall be stopped.

You do not have to implement the discovery by yourself if you don't want to. Check out the *Tube Mail* discovery libraries - they are fully compatible:
 * [tubemail-mdns](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail-mdns): Discovers other peers on the local network using mDNS / DNS-SD.
 * [tubemail-dht](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail-dht): (Ab)uses the Bittorrent DHT for discovering peers on the internet. TBH: This feels a little bit magical :) Don't forget to forward the ports if you are forced to have your peer behind some *evil* NAT.

Resolved ```bus``` is an instance of Bus.

## Class: Bus

### Property: realm

Information about the connection. See [Tube Mail Realm](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail#class-realm) for details. But please keep your hands off the ```send()``` method ;)

### Method: emit

```js
bus.emit(event, [...args]);
```

Raises ```event``` and hands over optional ```...args``` to all listeners.

### Method: on

```js
bus.on(selector, callback);
```

With ```selector``` events to listen on is can be specified. On top it allows for wildcards:
 * '+' matches all characters expect from '.'. Thus '.' is a predestined delimiter for grouping events.
 * '#' matches every character without any exceptions.

The function ```callback``` is called if an event occurs that matches ```selector```. The event's ```...args``` are the function call's arguments. In the function's scope ```this``` is an object with the items:
 * ```event```: The event name. This is handy if many events would match ```selector```.
 * ```source```: The source of the event. For details lookup [Tube Mail Peer](https://github.com/jue89/node-tubemail#class-neighbour).


### Method: removeListener

```js
bus.removeListener(selector, callback);
```

Removes a previously added event listener. Call this with the same arguments you used for the ```bus.on(...)``` call.
